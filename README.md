# Named-Entity-Recognition-with-BERT

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and classifying entities (such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.) in a given text. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful pre-trained language model that has been widely used in various NLP tasks, including NER. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how NER with BERT works:

## Pre-training BERT:

BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text using a masked language model objective. It learns contextualized word representations by considering both left and right context in a bidirectional manner.
Fine-tuning for NER:

After pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like NER. This involves training the model on a labeled dataset containing examples of text with annotated entities.

## Tokenization:

The input text is tokenized into subwords or words, depending on the BERT model used. Each token is assigned an embedding vector based on its context in the sentence.

##Adding Special Tokens:

Special tokens, such as [CLS] (classification) and [SEP] (separator), are added to the tokenized input. [CLS] is used to represent the entire input for classification tasks, and [SEP] separates segments of the input.
Segment Embeddings:

BERT can handle multiple sentence inputs. For NER, a single sentence may be used, and segment embeddings are added to distinguish between different segments.
Position Embeddings:

BERT inherently doesn't consider the order of words, so position embeddings are added to provide information about the position of each token in the sequence.

## NER Labels:

Each token is associated with a label indicating whether it is part of an entity (e.g., B-PER for the beginning of a person's name, I-PER for inside a person's name).
Training Objective:

The fine-tuning process involves optimizing the model parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and true labels using a suitable loss function (commonly, cross-entropy loss).

## Inference:

During inference, the trained model takes a new text input, tokenizes it, and predicts the entity labels for each token. The output can then be post-processed to extract entities and their types.

## Post-processing:

Post-processing involves converting the predicted labels into recognizable entities and their types. This may include merging consecutive tokens with the same entity type.
